              Hospital Patient Management System Using Facial Recognition in
              Cambodia
            </h1>

          <h2>Abstract:</h2>
          <p>
            In Cambodia, healthcare facilities are increasingly adopting
            innovative technologies to improve patient management and streamline
            registration processes. This project introduces a hospital patient
            management system that leverages facial recognition technology to
            enhance the efficiency and accuracy of patient information access.
            The system employs Haar Cascade classifiers for face detection and
            Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) for face recognition,
            providing a robust and reliable solution tailored to the local
            context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The proposed system replaces traditional identification methods with
            a facial recognition approach, significantly reducing registration
            time and minimizing errors associated with manual data entry. Upon
            arrival, patients simply stand before a kiosk equipped with a camera
            that captures their facial features. The Haar Cascade algorithm
            swiftly detects the face, while the LBPH algorithm performs
            recognition by comparing the captured image with the stored patient
            database.
          </p>
          <p>
            The integration of this technology not only accelerates the
            registration process but also enhances security by ensuring that
            only authorized personnel can access sensitive patient information.
            The system is designed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive
            interface that guides patients through the recognition process
            seamlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, the implementation of a facial recognition-based
            patient management system in Cambodian hospitals represents a
            significant step towards modernizing healthcare services. By
            utilizing Haar Cascade for face detection and LBPH for face
            recognition, this project demonstrates the potential for technology
            to transform patient experiences, improve operational efficiency,
            and ensure high standards of data security in healthcare settings.
